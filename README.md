 **All modules already installed**

# Quick start 
    nodemon app.js 
    
# What works ?
  
  - Convert line from input text to command line for shell
  - Forbidden access to the shell if you are not authenticated (JWT / login system)
  - Login to authenticated with error management and redirect automaticly to index if the connection dosn't work
  - JWT at the connection with the login (mandatory to use the web shell !)

# What dosn't works ?
  - SSL connection (can't generate key and certificate)
